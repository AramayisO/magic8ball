## Description
This project was built as my final project for [Geekwise Academy's](https://geekwiseacademy.com/) Javascript for Beginners course. The project was build using modern, modular, ES6 JavaScript. The application is written entirely in vanilla JavaScript, but was heavily inspired by trying to imitate the React libary - in particular, tyring to immitate JSX.
